## Though Process
After reading the assignment, I started to plan my process. My main purpose was to create a happy flow and as long as I had time to add more.
After I am done with the user interface and responsive design, the first priority was to create the query for fetching the locations list.
I used some static query, language and limit parameters in order to display the list at user. 
Afterwards I fetched data according to user input, set the language according to the language of the browser and limited the number of results according to which device is used. After that I started the implementation to copy the selected item into the input field and by clicking the button user redirects to Google.
After finishing with this, I put a check to deactivate the button and started thinking how I could delay the request until a user stopped typing. For this implementation, I had to do some research. In the end I used a debounce function from lodash which I set to do the fetch after a few seconds while user stop typing.
I continued with the validation for the input field and added a loading message.
Before submitting my assignment, I did some code refactoring and wrote this README.
